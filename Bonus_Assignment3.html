    <h3>Storyline: </h3>
    <p>
        The film follows Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled "extractor" who specializes in the art of
        "extraction" — stealing valuable secrets from deep within a person's subconscious while they dream. Cobb is a
        fugitive, unable to return to his children in the United States due to accusations he did not commit. His one
        chance to redeem himself and go home comes when a wealthy businessman, Saito (Ken Watanabe), offers him a job to
        perform "inception" — planting an idea in someone’s mind rather than stealing one.
        <br>
        <br>
        The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), heir to a massive energy empire. The goal is to plant the idea in
        Fischer's mind that he should break up his father’s company, which will allow Saito to gain a significant
        advantage in the business world. This task is far more difficult than extraction, as inception requires careful
        planning and the precise manipulation of Fischer’s subconscious.
        <br>
        <br>
        Cobb assembles a team for the job:
        <br>
        <br>
        Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his loyal partner and expert in dream logistics.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ariadne (Elliot Page), a young architecture student who designs the dream worlds.
        <br>
        <br>
        Eames (Tom Hardy), a forger who can assume other identities within dreams.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who creates the sedative needed to stabilize the multi-layered dream.
        <br>
        <br>
        They enter Fischer’s mind through a dream within a dream within a dream — a three-layered dream structure. As
        they dive deeper into each layer, time dilates, and the dangers increase. The team faces projections of
        Fischer’s subconscious that try to stop them, and Cobb is also confronted by his own subconscious projections,
        particularly his deceased wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), whose appearance disturbs Cobb’s concentration and
        threatens the mission.
        <br>
        <br>
        Cobb is haunted by the guilt of his wife’s death, which he believes was his fault. Mal’s presence in the dreams
        represents Cobb’s unresolved emotions and trauma. Throughout the journey, Cobb is forced to confront his guilt
        and finally deal with the truth about Mal’s death, which is essential to completing the mission.

    <h3>Review: </h3>
    <p>
        *Inception* (2010), directed by Christopher Nolan, is a mind-bending thriller that blends a high-concept heist
        plot with deep emotional storytelling. The film follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a thief who specializes in
        stealing secrets from within dreams, as he’s tasked with planting an idea in someone’s mind — a process known as
        **inception**. The narrative is complex, featuring dreams within dreams and a layered structure that challenges
        the audience’s perception of reality.
        <br>
        <br>
        The film excels visually, with stunning sequences like the rotating hallway fight and the cityscapes bending in
        on themselves. Hans Zimmer’s haunting score amplifies the emotional and intellectual intensity, while the
        stellar cast, including DiCaprio, Marion Cotillard, and Tom Hardy, deliver strong performances.
        <br>
        <br>
        Themes of guilt, memory, and reality run deep throughout the film, with Nolan exploring the subconscious and
        leaving the audience with an open-ended conclusion that sparks debate. While the plot can be confusing for some
        and certain characters feel underdeveloped, *Inception* is a visually spectacular and intellectually stimulating
        film that rewards multiple viewings. It’s a modern classic that pushes the boundaries of storytelling in cinema.
